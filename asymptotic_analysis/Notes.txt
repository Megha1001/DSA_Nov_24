Asymptotic Ananlysis
----------------------
-> The idea is to measure order of growth. (We meaure order of growth of time taken by a functional program, in terms of input size.)
-> Doesn't depend upon machine, programming language etc.
-> No need to implement, we can analyze algorithm.

Assumptions
------------
-> Mathematical operations like addition, substraction, division, multiplication etc taken same time (whether you add 1+1 or 10000000+100000000, its consider to take same time)
